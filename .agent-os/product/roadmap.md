## Phase 1: Complete Simple Flow (CURRENT PRIORITY) ðŸŽ¯

**Goal:** Get a working end-to-end coin flip game with no errors
**Success Criteria:** Create game â†’ Join game â†’ Make commitments â†’ Reveal choices â†’ Winner paid

### Critical Path to Working Flow

- [ ] **End-to-End Testing** - Manual testing of complete game flow `S`
  - Create game with Player A
  - Join game with Player B
  - Player A makes commitment (heads/tails + secret)
  - Player B makes commitment (heads/tails + secret)
  - Player A reveals choice
  - Player B reveals choice (auto-resolves game)
  - Winner receives payout
  - Verify all funds distributed correctly

- [ ] **Fix Any Blocking Issues** - Address errors that prevent flow completion `M`
  - Commitment generation working correctly

### Testing Checklist
