# Product Mission (Lite)

FlipCoin is a provably fair blockchain gaming platform on Solana that enables users to participate in transparent 1v1 betting games with instant crypto payouts, leveraging client-side commitment storage to ensure even the house cannot cheat.

This platform serves both casual gamers and crypto enthusiasts who want genuinely fair betting with transparent odds. Unlike traditional gambling sites where the house can see your choice, FlipCoin stores your commitment exclusively on your device (IndexedDB + localStorage) - the backend literally cannot access your secrets. Combined with Solana's sub-cent fees and sub-second finality, this creates the most transparent and affordable peer-to-peer betting experience available. Future expansion to mobile app and additional game types (Rock-Paper-Scissors, Dice) planned.
